## A simple C library to manage command line parameters ##

There are already many tools that serve this purpose: given a program with many possible command line switches, it is often difficult to manage everything cleanly in the code. This library aims to be _small_ and _simple_ to use, providing only the most crucial features. There will soon be some examples provided; in this earliest of stages all that is given is the API in the header file. Eventually, this library will merely be compiled with the project as additional source code.
